# Section Library
Allows saving the section as a template, so we can reuse it again in other pages or same pages as a duplicate, whether the section blocks are generic or inline the module differentiate between them and builds new instances for the inline blocks.

### FEATURES
Content Based: The content editor (Layout Manager) can save any created section(s) to the library to reuse it over and over.

Build single, or multiple sections as a template: Save individual section or combine multiple sections (or all sections on the page) as a template.

### REQUIREMENTS
Drupal Core Layout Builder module.

### INSTALLATION
Install like any other contributed Drupal module.

See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-contributed-... for further information.

### RECOMMENDATION
You can use this module with Optional modules like:

Layout Builder Modal: Replace the default off-canvas dialog with modal, so it will show more modern library.

### SIMILAR MODULES
The key difference between this module and the Layout Builder Library module that the latter builds a full page template and is config based. The Section Library is content based so the content editor can create templates on the fly without import/export configs, also it builds templates for the section or multiple combined sections (page) templates.
There is no overlapping between the two modules and you can use both at the same time.
